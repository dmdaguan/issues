  "body": "### What is hasura/issues?\r\nhasura/issues is a simple view that pulls data from github and gitlab repos that helps the entire team understand project progress. It also has a few utilities to automatically send out emails, show blocking tasks and extract time spent on a task (using issue description). \r\n\r\n### Why this tool?\r\nThe idea is to remove all overhead with task tracking and project progress.\r\nNo extra tools, no multiple sources of truth about what is going on for developers, project managers etc.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n1. Project progress\r\n2. List issues for the same milestone across github, gitlab repos\r\n3. Parse issue description to show blocking tasks\r\n4. Automatic progress progress emails for an active milestone\r\n5. Automatic daily report of issues opened and closed in case of no active milestone\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\nhasura/issues is a node service that is deployed per project. All configuration is only via env variables.\r\nHere's a list of env vars, what they mean and how to configure them:\r\n\r\n1. ``GITLAB``: ``XXXX_YOUR_GITLAB_API_TOKENXXXX``\r\n2. ``GITHUB``: ``XXXX_YOUR_GITHUB_API_TOKENXXXX``\r\n3. ``MILESTONES``: ``{\"milestone_x\": {\"start\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\", \"end\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"}, \"milestone_y\"...}``\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/hasura/issues/issues) (ohmygod) to file issues and raise any support requests!",
